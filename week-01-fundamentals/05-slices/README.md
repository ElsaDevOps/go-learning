# Paint a picture
A function Pic, which returns a slice of length dy, each element of which is a slice of dx 8-bit unsigned integers. When you run the program, it will display a icture, picture, interpreting the integers as grayscale (well, bluescale) values. 

## What I learned

- How to create images using slices
- How to use a for loop to iterate over the slices
- How to create a slice with make to create dynamically sized arrays
